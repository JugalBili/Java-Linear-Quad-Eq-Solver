Now that you found all information about your Linear graph,
its time to understand how to interpretate the actal equation. 
Remember to convert your equation into slope/y-intercept 
form before following this lesson. 
For this example we will be using the equation: y = 2x-4.

To find the coordinates for this equation we will be 
substituting the x coordinate as x, and solving for y. 
For example if you want to find the coordinate at x = 3
you can solve by substituting 3 as x and solving for y.
In this example the coordinate is (3,2).

The slope of the linear equation is is how much the line rises
ever unit, and it can be calculated by rise/run or if you have 
2 coordinates; (y2-y1)/(x2-x1). The slope is also represented
by the 'm' value, which in this case is 2. 

The next step is to find the intercepts. For the y-intercept, you would 
need to substitite x as 0 and solve for y. In this case the y-intercept
is at (0,-4), or you can simply look at the 'b' value which is the 
y-intercept. 
To find the x-intercepts, you would need to substitute y as 0, and solve
for x. In this case the point of the x-intercept is (2,0). 

From this information, you are able to solve many linear word problems, 
and reading this lesson would hopefully prepare you for the test.
